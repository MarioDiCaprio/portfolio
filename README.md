    This website is my personal portfolio! It is a website created with the

    framework and hosted on
    <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vercel</a>.

# Tech Stack

This application was developed with the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

# Project Structure

For maintainability reasons, this project is structured in a very clear
and intuitive manner:
- Components are stored each in their own directories under `/src/components`.
  This includes, but may not be limited to:
  - The component itself
  - Styles for the component
  - Framer-Motion animations
- Pages are stored under `/src/pages`, in accordance with the Next JS
  directory structure.
- More general styles and animations, as well as styles and animations for
  individual pages, are stored under `/src/styles`

Many thanks to [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com), whose website
