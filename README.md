# Tech Stack

This application was developed with the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

# Project Structure

For maintainability reasons, this project is structured in a very clear
and intuitive manner:
- Components are stored each in their own directories under `/src/components`.
  This includes, but may not be limited to:
  - The component itself
  - Styles for the component
  - Framer-Motion animations
- Pages are stored under `/src/pages`, in accordance with the Next JS
  directory structure.
- More general styles and animations, as well as styles and animations for
  individual pages, are stored under `/src/styles`
- Page stories are stored under `/src/stories`.

# Storybook

Ideally, all components have a story to view them in isolation. The storybook
for this application is deployed on [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/)
and is publicly accessible [here](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=6417438718d9224ca85e6f32).
